2. Feature Engineering: Introduce new columns like 'time_of_day,' 'day_name,' and 'month_name' for detailed sales insights.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize data exploration to answer specific project goals and questions.

Conclusion:
The analysis focuses on addressing crucial business questions related to cities, product lines, payment methods, revenue, COGS, customer types, and more. The outcomes aim to guide strategic decisions and improvements in Walmart's sales operations.

Business Questions to Address:
